/*
TODO: Task: Write a Copier class with a copy() method on it. When the copy() method is called, the copier should read from a Source one character at a time and write this character to a Desfinafion. It should do this repeatedly until a newline ('\n') is encountered when reading, at which point it should stop, without writing the newline to the Destination.

~ Do the above withouf using "real" Source and Desfination implemenfafions â€” test doubles should be used for fhese.
